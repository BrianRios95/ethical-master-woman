            Hello everyone. üñêüññ <br />For those who don‚Äôt know me, I am
            Florencia, and I‚Äôve been chosen as the ethical master woman from my
            country, and maybe you wonder how did I achieved it? And what does
            it mean to be an ethical person? So, let me tell you that I was
            becoming one without understand what it meant when I started to
            become aware about how we were destroying the planet and I changed
            the way I lived. üôå
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            So, today‚Äôs post is gonna be about this topic because most of us
            worry about, and I would like you to share your comments about how
            eco-friendly you are, but first What does eco-friendly mean? In my
            opinion, it‚Äôs a person who try to reduce at minimum our impact in
            the environment. I consider myself as an eco-friendly person, but I
            keep working to improve and I must say that it is not easy because
            it‚Äôs more expensive to be ecological, for example, I got rid of the
            car and I bought a bike, but I had to hire a bicycle insurance. I
            began to eat organic food instead of meat and pre-prepared, At that
            moment I realized that trash food is cheaper than healthier. I
            organized rubbish in different trash can and I threw them in
            recycling containers which ones were far away from my home. üòî
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            For all this, I have many projects to run like get subsidies from
            the government so that low-income people can opt for a greener way
            of life, guarantee education on these topics, penalize people who
            pollute and many more things.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            But then I thought a little bit more, and I realized that it wasn‚Äôt
            only about me. We need more people to make a difference, so I
            gathered a group of volunteers to pick up rubbish from the squares
            and isolated places 1 time a week. I know it is not enough, but that
            is why I am here, to invite you to join us, because it is your place
            in this world. If we continue for this way, tomorrow will be late.
            üí™
